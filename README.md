This slime model was developed for university coursework as one component of a report for slime mold movement towards food sources. This is a basic agent based model simulation. 

There are low dependencies, and this was developed before I understood precisely how a class worked (hence a lack of __init__). I plan rewrite this project entirely in a superior way.
